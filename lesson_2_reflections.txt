What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You get a .git folder that will keep track of metadata/history

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It lets you go over things you're about to commit, and you can decide what stays or goes into the repository and without moving around files to/from working directory.
